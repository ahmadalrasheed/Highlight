## Highlight

### Description

***is a website to give the users an easy way to record them themselves if they are trying to practice for any meetup or presentation, Highlight asks the user for the permission to acces their camera and microphone, then the user will be able to start with his speech and will be capable of downloading his speech as a recorded video, in addition, the user will see his video ready to be played on the website.***

MVP : 

* I expect that the user will have a user-fiendly website with awesome user interface
* I expect that the user will be able to have his own stream, plus the ability to record his stream and download it.

Future Goal:

* to Build streaming webapplication, so that every user can have his stream and also visit others stream
